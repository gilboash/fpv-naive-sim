# fpvsim — working notes

## Status
Fresh project. Scope undefined as of 2026-08-23.

## Conventions carried over from ../genius-invester
Worth keeping, because they were learned the expensive way there:

- **Verify, do not assert.** "Deployed" means a check ran against the running
  thing, not that a command exited 0.
- **Make guarantees structural, not procedural.** Database triggers over
  discipline; a hashed file over a promise not to edit it.
- **A guard that hides a missing function is worse than the error it hides.**
  A `hasattr` fallback there silently fed an empty portfolio to a live model.
- **Anchored ignore patterns.** An unanchored `data/` in `.gitignore` matched
  every directory of that name at any depth and silently dropped two different
  datasets, weeks apart.
